# CurrenSee
-----------------------------
### Fake currency identifier using Neural Networks in Pytorch
### The aim of this project is to test the authenticity of  currency notes by preparing a system which takes the image of currency bill as input by converting those images into wavelets and gives the Ô¨Ånal result by applying various Machine learning and Neural network techniques and algorithms.
-----------------------------------


## Libraries and Tools
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. PyTorch
4. Matplotlib
5. Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset contains these four input characteristics:

- The variance of the image transformed into wavelets
- The asymmetry of the image transformed into wavelets
- Kurtosis of the image transformed into wavelets
- Image entropy

The target value is simply 0 for **real** banknotes and 1 for **fake** banknotes.

In this repository you have:
- The fake currency identifier model.
- The python file of the project.
- The datset used for the project. 


## That's all
That's all about this project, folks!
